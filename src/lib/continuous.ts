 * little off shows more of the same design instead of a seam. It reads the design uploaded as the banknote's
 * background as it shows there (cut to the banknote's proportions, centred, over its colour), compares each edge with
 * the one across from it and finds where they break. The cut tolerance is how far the cut may land either side of each
 * edge; the drift previews a cut that far off and is never saved. The same reading checks two rules the brief sets for
