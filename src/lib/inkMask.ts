 * is whatever is lighter or darker than it, as far as it is, past the background's own speckle (so a JPEG's stays
 * clear). Cut out of transparency, the shape takes the ink, rounded corners and all, less whatever is drawn on it in
 * another colour, as far as that stands out from the shape's own main colour: a strip with its 15 drawn in the paper's
 * colour prints with the 15 left open, and a shape of one colour, whatever it is, prints solid (Keller, 6 November: his
 * 15 strip came out one flat bar while a cutout was read by its outline alone). Either way the strongest part, bar a few
 * stray pixels, counts in full, so a faint scan prints solid, and soft parts stay soft, as thinner ink: clean art (an
 * SVG, pure black and white, a clean cutout) comes out crisp by itself, and soft art as drawn (Keller chose this over a
 * hard limit at each spot). Only brightness counts, as for the watermark. Inverted, the ink goes round the shape instead.
